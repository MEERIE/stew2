# Question 65

Concat(str1, str2) returns a single string consisting of str1 followed by str2.

Substring(str, start, length) returns a substring of consecutive characters from str, starting with the character at position start and containing length characters.

The task is to figure out which combination of these procedures can be used to store the string "jackalope" in the string variable animal. The question requires selecting two correct sets of procedure calls that achieve this goal.

## Correct Answer C:

animal ← Substring("jackrabbit", 1, 4) extracts "jack" from "jackrabbit".
animal ← Concat(animal, "a") appends "a" to "jack", resulting in "jacka".
animal ← Concat(animal, Substring("antelope", 5, 4)) extracts "lope" from "antelope" and appends it to "jacka", resulting in "jackalope".

## Incorrect Answer D:

animal ← Substring("jackrabbit", 1, 4) extracts "jack" from "jackrabbit".
animal ← Concat(animal, "a") appends "a" to "jack", resulting in "jacka".
animal ← Concat(Substring("antelope", 5, 4), animal) is slightly misleading because it extracts "lope" from "antelope" and should prepend it to "jacka", but this is incorrect because it would result in "lopejacka".
the operations in Answer D would not result in "jackalope".

animal ← Substring("antelope", 5, 4) would assign the substring "lope" from "antelope" to the variable animal.
animal ← Concat("a", animal) would then prepend "a" to "lope", resulting in "alope".
animal ← Concat(Substring("jackrabbit", 1, 4), animal) would take the substring "jack" from "jackrabbit" and then concatenate it with "alope" resulting in "jackalope".

The process outlined in Answer B does indeed result in the string "jackalope", with the first step isolating "lope" from "antelope", the second step creating the string "alope" by prepending "a" to "lope", and the final step creating the correct string by prepending "jack" to "alope".
