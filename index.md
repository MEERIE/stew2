<h1 style="color: purple;"> AMEER'S BLOG </h1>
<p>My name is Ameer Hussain. I was raised in NYC and moved here to sunny San Diego. I'm taking AP compsci because my late grandma always believed that coding and technology was the future (she had very limited information about computers). She used to tell me that I was special and would be great. She told me that I would grow into my name - Ameer, which means prince & rich. We were very close, and in one ofthe last conversations we had she reminded me to go forth and embrace the future (of technology) and become great like she always believed I would.</p>

<h1>Errors I Ran Into: Trouble Shooting</h1>
<p> Well this is an easy section for me especially since the whole last week until thursday night I didn't even have python installed due to my computer not being updated. My partner Kayden also had issues with installing packages and for what seemed like an eternity we stayed stagnant. Fortunately I asked you for a server to use the cloud for this project and because I had done the steps a hundered times I got everything done including writing this in the span of an hour!</p>
